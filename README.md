- VLC media player
- Neofetch (system information)

### Applications via Snap
- Obsidian (note-taking)
- Discord (communication)
- IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (IDE)
- DataGrip (database tool)
- Redis Insight (Redis GUI)

## 📋 Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux distributions
- **User Privileges**: sudo access required
- **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading packages and repositories

## 🔧 Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Make the installer executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Run the automated setup
./install.sh
```

### Manual Component Installation

You can also run individual setup scripts:

```bash
# Core system packages
./scripts/setup_linux.sh

# Programming environments
./scripts/setup_environment.sh

# Snap packages
./scripts/setup_snap.sh

# Docker
./scripts/application/setup_docker.sh

# Brave browser
./scripts/application/setup_brave.sh
```

## 🔍 Verification

After installation, verify your setup:

```bash
# Check programming languages
java -version
node -v
python3 --version

# Check applications
docker --version
brave-browser --version
snap list

# Check services
systemctl status docker
systemctl status snapd
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding APT Packages
Edit `scripts/apt_packages.txt`:
```
# Add your packages here
package-name
another-package
```

### Adding Snap Packages
Edit `scripts/snap_packages.txt`:
```
# Add snap packages here
package-name
package-with-options --classic
```

### Adding Custom Scripts
1. Create your script in the appropriate directory
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x your-script.sh`
3. Add it to the main `install.sh` flow

## 📝 Post-Installation Notes

### Docker Usage
- You may need to log out and back in for Docker group permissions
- Test Docker: `docker run hello-world`

### Environment Variables
- Snap binaries are added to PATH in `~/.bashrc`
- Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`

### Version Management
- Java alternatives are configured automatically
- Python 3.12 is set as the default python3
- Node.js LTS is installed via NodeSource

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure you have sudo access
2. **Package Not Found**: Update package lists with `sudo apt update`
3. **Snap Installation Fails**: Restart snapd service and try again
4. **Docker Permission Issues**: Log out and back in after installation

### Logs and Debugging
- All scripts provide detailed colored output
- Check individual script logs for specific issues
- Run scripts individually to isolate problems
